### 👨‍💻 Background

I am a researcher and student with a strong interdisciplinary background in **Mathematics** and **Computer Science**. My work is driven by a desire to build theoretically sound and efficient AI systems.

* **Mathematical Foundation:** My research is grounded in Functional Analysis (Spectral Theory, Compact Operators) and Numerical Analysis (Von Neumann Stability).
* **Engineering Capability:** I have experience in high-performance networking (TCP/IP) and system architecture, ensuring my algorithms are not just theoretical but scalable.
* **Coding:** Python, C++.

### 🔭 Research Interests

My primary research focuses on **Artificial Intelligence**, with specific interests in:

* **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Contextual MDPs, Efficient Exploration.
* **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Long-context understanding, Intent recognition.
* **Representation Learning:** Information-theoretic approaches to state abstraction.
