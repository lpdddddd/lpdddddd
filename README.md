### 👨‍💻 Background

I am an undergraduate student at **Sichuan University (SCU)**, pursuing a **Double Degree in Mathematics and Intelligent Technology**. My research bridges the gap between theoretical mathematics and modern AI systems.

* **Mathematical Foundation:** My work is grounded in rigorous mathematics, including **Functional Analysis** (Spectral Theory, Compact Operators) and **Numerical Analysis**.
* **Research Focus:** I apply these mathematical principles to **Reinforcement Learning** and **LLMs**, ensuring algorithms are theoretically sound and efficient.
* **Engineering:** Experienced in C++ and Python, with system-level knowledge in networking (TCP/IP).

### 🔭 Research Interests

My primary research focuses on **Artificial Intelligence**, with specific interests in:

* **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Contextual MDPs, Efficient Exploration.
* **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Long-context understanding, Intent recognition.
* **Representation Learning:** Information-theoretic approaches to state abstraction.
